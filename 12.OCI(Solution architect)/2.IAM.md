- ***AAA** means **Authentication, Authorization and Auditing** 
- **Authentication** means who are you 
- **Authorization** means what have been assigned you by administrator
- **Auditing** means what resources you have used 
- you have assigned fine-grained permission to user(less permission)
- **Users =>Groups =>Policies =>VM=>Compartments=>

# AuthN

- Principals are two types **IAM users and Resources like vm instance**

- There are three types of Authentication like **OCI API+SDK/CLI, RSA Key(PEM) and Authentication Token**

  

# AuthZ

- means what permission have been assigned to particular user
- policy has divided into three parts
  - **Subject** means group, dynamic groups and resources
  - **Action** like inspect, read, and use(modify pre-existing resources) and manage(to do anything on the resources)
  - **Aggregate-resource-type** like all-resources, database-family, instance-family, object-family, network-family and volume-family
  - **Individual-resource-type** like db-system, db-node, db-home, instances, instance-image, volume-attachments, volume-backups

# Compartments

- you organize your resource in better way. you make compartments for you individual project
- where you can see what resources are used by this project like, vm, buckets
- you make quota for your compartments like what can you create in this compartment and which type of vm you can use in this compartment
- if you want to set policy to grand children so you give like A:B:C

# Dynamic Groups

- **Ephemeral Principals** means temporary credentials to any one for short period of time

- Allow infrastructure, stacked and ephemeral principals to be grouped as **Principal actors** similar to other groups

- policies allow dynamic group to make a API calls against OCI resources

  ```json
  Any {instance.compartment.id="ocid"}
  # another example
  Any {resource.type="dbaa",
      resource.compartment.id="ocid"}
  # policy for dynamic group
  Allow dynamic-group InstanceA to manage objects in tenancy where all {target.bucket.name="Log", target.region.name="us-east1"} 
  ```

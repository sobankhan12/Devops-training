# Attributes

- ## Introduction

  - Attributes are key value pair that represent specific detail about node.

- ## Why we use attributes?

  To determine

  - The current state of the node.
  - what was the state of the node when the previous chef client run.
  - what would be the state of the node after the current chef client run.

- ## Who use it

  - chef-client use it.

- ## Types of attributes

  - default,force-default,normal,override,force-override and automatic.
  - **Default** is the lowest priority and **Automatic** is the highest priority.
  - **Automatic** has the highest priority due to **Ohai**.

- ## Who defines attributes

  - Nodes,Cookbook,Rules and environment and Recipes.

- ### Note:

  Attributes define by ohai has the highest priority than the attributes define by recipe.

  least priority will be attributes of recipes files.

  ```bash
  # create a cookbook an recipe
  $ chef generate cookbook apache-cookbook
  # go inside cookbook 
  $ cd apache-cookbook
  # create recipe
  $ chef generate recipe apacahe-recipe
  # came back to root directory
  $ cd ..
  # open the recipe file
  $ vi apache-cookbook/recipes/apache-recipe.rb
  ```

  ```basic
  file "/basic" do
      content "This is to get basic info
      HOSTNAME: #{node['hostname']}
      IPADDRESS: #{node['ipaddress']}
      CPU: #{node['cpu']['0]['mhz']}
      MEMORY: #{node['memory']['total']}"
      owner "root"
      group "root"
      action :create
      end                             
  ```

  ```bash
  # create a recipe
  $ chef-client -zr "recipe[apache-cookbook::apache-recipe]"
  ```

  

- ## How to execute Linux command in chef?

  - you can execute Linux command but you have care that it will run every time when ever you need  so you have to avoid  from it.

    ```basic
    # write Linux command here
    execute "run a script" do
        command <<-EOH
        mkdir /sobandir
        touch /sobanfile
        EOH
    end
    ```

    

- ## How to create users an group in chef

  ```basic
  user "amanat" do
      action :create 
  end
  group "tecnical coding" do
  members "soban" 
  append true
  end
  ```

  

- ## What is convergence?

  - We run chef-client to apply  recipe to bring a node to desire state it is known as convergence.

- ## What is run list?

  - To run recipes in sequence order but we mention in run list.

  - you can run one recipe from one cookbook 

    ```bash
    $ chef-client -zr "recipe[apache-cookbook::apache-recie],recipe[test-cookbook::test-apache]"
    ```

    

- ## How to includes other recipes in one recipe?

  - To call other recipes or run multiple recipes from single recipe

  - all recipes must be from same cookbook

    ```bash
    $ vi testbook/resipes/test-recipe.rb
    # you have names of recipes in the start of the file
    include_recipe "test-book::recipe1"
    include_recipe "test-book::recipe2"
    ```

    

    

- ## How to run multiple recipes from multiple cookbooks

  - first you includes other recipes in default recipe the run this command\

    ```bash
    $ chef-client -zr "recipe[test-cookbook::default],recipe[test-cookbook::recipe2]"
    ```

# Configuration Management Tools

- ## Configuration

  - each and every minor detail of your machine. Like we say configuration of your laptop

     

- ## Management

  - make secure of server machine

    

- ## Why we need configuration management tools?

  - there was popular job of system administrator that who manage and configure software or files on every machine this method was good for small organization but with passage of time company grows up and now server machines amount grows up to 500 then this was difficult to manage all server so we need automation that every will configured within a minutes so configuration management tools come into market that help organization to automate their tasks with these configuration management tools
  - Ansible,puppet,chef these are the examples of configuration management tools

- ## Push Based configuration Tools

  - We will push updates to all nodes  with one single server then nodes will update their software.
  - it is implemented where we want to update small changes by yourself
  - Ansible and SaltStack is push based configuration tool  

- ## Pull Based Configuration tools

  - all nodes check version of software with server software version

  - if version of server is not matched with nodes so nodes upgrade herself 

    with version of server.

  - Chef and Puppet are Pull based Configuration tool

  - if there are new machines are added to cluster so we preferred Chef or pull base configuration

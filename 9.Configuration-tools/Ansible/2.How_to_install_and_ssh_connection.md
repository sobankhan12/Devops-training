# How to install Ansible and ssh connection to all nodes

- ## There are steps to follow to complete these task

  1. download epel repository

     ```bash
     $ wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
     ```

  2. install this epel repo

     ```bash
     $ yum install "download package" -y
     ```

  3. update epel package and install all individual packages

     ```bash
     $ yum update -y
     $ yum install git python python-devel python-pip openssl ansible -y
     # check ansible version
     $ ansible --version
     ```
     
  4. Now add private IPs of all node machines so that it can talk to them

     ```bash
     $ vi /etc/ansible/hosts
     # npw add ips of node machine  by making group of them
     [productins]
     172.15.13.323 ansible_user=ansible2
     172.15.13.323 ansible_user=ansible3
     ```
     
  5. Now update the configuration file so that hosts file can work

     ```bash
     $ vi /etc/ansible/ansible.config
     # uncommented this multiple lines
     inventroy = /etc/ansible/hosts
     sudo-users = root
     ```

  6. create ansible users  for all servers and nodes

     ```bash
     $ useradd ansible
     # now set password for it
     $ passwd ansible
     ```
     
  7. Give users all privileges you do this same work in nodes also to give permission
  
     ```bash
     # open visudo file
     $ visudo
     # add this thing in your file to give permission to your file
     ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL 
     ```
  
  8. How to sshd configuration to make connection with nodes and do this step in nodes also
  
     ```bash
     # open file sshd_config
     $ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     # uncomment permitRootlogin yes
     # Uncomment PasswordAuthentication yes
     # Comment PasswordAuthentication no
     
     ```
     
  9. How to copy of public keys from server to all nodes that it give relief repetitions of password every to ssh to any node so we generate ssh public key
  
     ```bash
     # generate ssh public keys in ansible server
     $ ssh-keygen
     # go to directoy .ssh/
     $ cd .ssh/
     # copy public key to all nodes to make password less connection
     $ ssh-copy-id "name of user"@172.123.33.45     "this is private ip of nodes"
      ssh-copy-id "name of user"@172.123.33.45     "this is private ip of node for secpnd"
     
     ```
 # Host Pattern
 ```bash
# how to see all hosts
$ ansible all --list-hosts
# how to see hosts from groups
$ ansible production --list-hosts
 how to see host by specific number
$ ansible production[1] --list-hosts
 ```

### How to add make children and parent group

```basic
[web-server]
192.12.12.23
[app-server]
23.43.34.12
# make children all theses groups of common parent group
[common:children]
web-server
app-server
```

```bash
# now see children of parent group
$ ansible common --list-hosts
```

### How to make custom inventory file

```bash
$ vi /myinventroy/myfile
# how to see hosts of my custom inventory file
$ ansible all --list-host -i /myinventory/myfile
# now change default path of inventory file and put your custom path like this
$ /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
inventroy=/myinventory/myfile
# now see hosts
$ ansible all --list-hosts 

```

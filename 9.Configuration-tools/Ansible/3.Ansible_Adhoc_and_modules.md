# Ansible Methods to push changes to nodes

- There are three methods to push codes to nodes machines. eg Ad-hoc, Modules and Playbooks

  - ## Ad-hoc(means temporary)

    - It is simple Linux command.

    - There is no idempotency(means no sense to understand that the task is completed already and it override again and again )

    - Ad-hoc command is used where just want do task only time like (machines shutdown, start, create files on 100 nodes quickly)

    - if we don't  how to any particular  task in modules an playbook then we use **Ad-hoc** 

    - The ansible ad-hoc uses the  **/usr/bin/ansible**  command line tool to automate the single task

    - Ad-hoc commands are the commands that can be run individually  to perform quick function

    - So we do not prefer this method for configuration management and deployment.

    - So we use less Ad-hoc command

      ``` bash
      # here we ad-hoc commands to perfom action on our nodes
      # to see ls on specific group like demo
      $ ansible demo -a "ls"
      # -a is aurgument
      # to see all nodes
      $ ansible all -a "ls"
      # to see ls on specific node of group
      $ ansible demo[4] -a "ls -al"
      # intall package on nodes
      $ ansible demo -a "sudo yum intall httpd -y"
      # install package by using -b it is same work like sudo for privileges
      $ ansible demo -ba "yum remove httpd -y"
      # add user in node using commands
      $ ansible demo -a "useradd tariq"
      ```

      

  - ## Modules

    - it is used for single task  e.g like you want install apache server so module is perfect

    - Ansible ships with the number of modules that we can say it **module library** that can be executed direct through remote hosts and playbooks 

    - Modules of library can be resides on any remote hosts and databases or demon

    - The default location of inventory file  is **/etc/ansible/hosts** 

    - ## Important Note

      - There is idempotency in modules and playbooks and it is possible due to setup command that run behind scenes. 
      - **Setup** has the current configuration of all nodes 

      ```bash
      # how to install httpd package in module -m is used for module 
      $ ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present"
      # there are diferrent state present=install absent=uninstall latest=update
      # how to uninstall package -b for sudo
      $ ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd stat=absent"
      # service related
      $ ansible demo -b -m service -a "name=httpd started"
      # users related
      $ ansible demo -b -m service -a "name=raj"
      # copy related
      $ ansible demo -m copy -a "src=/soban/asad.txt dest=/etc/nimko"
      
      ```

      

  - ## Playbook

    - it is we where we want to execute multiple tasks or modules at once so playbook come into play
    - combinations of modules is called playbook

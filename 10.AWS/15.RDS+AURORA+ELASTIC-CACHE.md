# RDS Overview

- it is stands for relational database service 
- it is managed by aws and it use **SQL** for query
- it allows you to create databases **Postgress, MySQL, Aurora, Microsoft, MariaDB and oracle**

# Advantages of using RDS service instead of db on your own ec2 instance

- RDS is managed service
  - Automatically Provisioning, OS patching
  - Automatically backup and restore to specific timestamp(Point in time Restore)
  - Monitoring dashboards
  - Read Replicas for (read query)
  - Multi AZ for DR(Disaster Recovery)
  - Maintenance window for upgrade
  - Scaling capacity(Horizontal and Vertical)
  - Storage backed by **gp2 or Io**

- But you can not do SSH in ec2 instance of RDS

# RDS Backup

- It is automatically backup for RDS is enabled
- Automated Backups
  - Fully backup on the daily bases(Maintenance Window)
  - Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 Minutes
  - Ability to restore at any point in time(from oldest backup to 5 minute ago)
- DB Snapshot
  - Manually taken the snapshot of your database
  - retention of backup as long as you want

# RDS Auto scaling

- Help you to increase RDS DB instance dynamically
- When RDS detects you are going out of free space it automatically scale
- Avoid manually scale your DBS storage
- You have to set **Maximum storage Threshold** for DB
- Automatically modify storage 
  - if free space is less than 10% of allocated storage
  - Low storage last at least 5 minutes
  - 6 hours passed for last modification

# RDS Read Replica for Read Scalability

- up to 5 Read Replicas of RDS
- within same AZ, Region, Cross-regions
- Replication is asynchronous so read eventually consistent
- Replica can be promoted to their own Db
- Application must update the connection string to leverage read replicas
- **Use Cases**
  - you have production db to take on normal load
  - you want to run reporting application to do some analytics
  - The production application is unaffected

- **Network Cost**
  -  in aws there is data fee to move data from one AZ to another AZ
  - **For Read replica you do not pay for the same region**
  - 

# RDS Multi AZ(Disaster Recovery)

- SYNC replication
- one dns name one failover go to another standby RDS
- Increase availability
- Failover in case of loss of AZ, network or storage
- No manual intervention in apps
- Not used for scaling
- **Read Replica can be setup for Multi AZ(Disaster Recovery)**

# RDS From single AZ to multi AZ

- Zero downtime operation(no need to stop db)
- just click to modify

# RDS encryption

- **AT Rest Encryption**
  - you can encrypt the master and read replica at the launch time with AWS KMS
  - if master is not encrypted then read replica will not be encrypted

- **In-flight Encryption**
  - SSL certificate to encrypt the data
  - Can copy of un-encrypted snapshot be  encrypted
  - 

- **To make encrypted RDS from un-encrypted RDS**
  - make a snapshot of that RDS then make NEW RDS which is encrypted

# Your Responsibility

- check port, security group, permission, in public subnet or not

# AWS Responsibility

- no ssh
- no manual db, OS patching
- no way to audit underlaying instance

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Amazon Aurora

- it is by aws and not open sourced
- it support MySql, PostgreSQL 
- it has three times more performance than both of the above
- aurora automatically grows 10GB to 128TB
- Aurora has 15 Replicas while MySql has 5 read replicas
- Failover is instantaneous . it is Horizontal scaling
- Aurora cost more 20% of MySql
-  

# Aurora high Availability and read Replica

- 6 copies of data in three availability zones
- 4 copies for write
- 3 copies for read replica
- self healing with peer-peer connection
- Storage is striped 100s volumes
- **Features of Aurora**
  - Automation backup, failover,recovery
  - isolation, security
  - patching, routine maintenance, backtrack

- **Use Cases of Aurora**
  - use it for fraud detection, ads targeting, and sentimental analytics

# Elastic Cache

- Elastic cache is to get managed Redis and memechaced

- Caches are in-memory and give high performance and low latency

- helps to reduce load for read intensive workload

- Helps to make your application stateless

- **Using elastic cache involves heavy application code changes**

- the application writes session data to the elastic cache

- the instance retrieve data and user is already login

- ### Redis

  - **Multi AZ with auto Failover**
  - Read Replicas to scale high availability 
  - Data Durability by using AOF persistence
  - Backup and restore features

- ### Meme cached

  - **Give high perfomance**

  - Multi-node for partitioning of data(Sharding)
  - No high availability(replication)
  - Non persistance
  - No Backup
  - No restore option

# Elastic cache security

- All caches are in elastic cache
  - **Do not support IAM Authentication**
  - IAM policy is used for aws-api call

- **Redis Authentication**(password, ssl certificate)
- **Memecached** support (SASL based authentication) 

# Pattern for Elastic cache

- **Lazy Loading**: all read data is cached, data can become stale in cached
- **Write through**: Adds, update data in cache when we are doing some changing in DB(No stale data)
- **session store** : store session data in cache(using TTL features)

# Elastic cache REDIS use case

- Gaming leaderboard are computationally complex
- Redis sorted guarantee both uniqueness and ordering
-

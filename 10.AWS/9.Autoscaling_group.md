# Auto Scaling Group

- Creating group of ec2 instances to scale out and scale in with requirement
- **Scale out means adding ec2 instances** and Scale in **removing ec2 instances**
- Enable the elasticity by scaling horizontally through adding or terminating ec2 instances
- Auto scaling ensure that you have the right number of ec2 instances
- There are three components of auto scaling group
  - **Launch Configuration** includes like instance, type, AMI, security group
  - **Auto scaling group** includes group name, size, vpc, subnet, health check period
  - **Scaling Policy** includes metric type(CPU utilization, ram utilization)  and target value

- if Auto scaling finds that ec2 instances launch by ASG is not balanced equally in all Subject **AZ** so it will balanced by itself

- While **Balancing** first increase the number of ec2 instances on that AZ where ec2 instances are less and decrease the number of ec2 instances in which AZ where ec2 are more than balance number

- **What cause Imbalance of ec2 instances**

  - if we manually remove ec2 instance from auto scaling group or we add instance in any AZ of auto scaling group

    

- We can attach a running ec2 instance to auto scaling group by using aws cli or aws console
- Instances must be running state to be include in auto scaling group not in (stopped or terminated)
- AMI used to launch new ec2 instance must present be that instance where from we make AMI
- Single Instance can be part of one auto scaling group at a time
- if the existing ec2 instance under the auto scaling group plus one to be needed exceed the max capacity of ec2 instance so the request would be fail and no one instance will be added but in the **Rebalancing** there is some relaxation
- you can remove instance manually by using aws console or cli but it will create another ec2 instance
- You can no do changes in Auto scaling group you must detached ec2 instance and create new auto scaling group and then attach these ec2 instances
- By deleting auto scaling group all ec2 instances will also be terminated
- you can reduce desired capacity of auto scaling group
- We can attach one or more load balancer to auto scaling group and both be in the same region
- when you connect load balancer with ASG then all new instances which will be created will also registered with load balancer
- Instances and ELB must be in the same group
- Health check grace period of ASG is **300s**
- Until the grace period of ASG is expired any unhealthy status reported by ec2 status check or by ELB to the auto scaling group will not be acted upon
- **After the grace period expired ASG would consider unhealthy ec2 instance in these following conditions**
  - if status of ec2 is unhealthy or state is other than running
  - if the elb says that the service is out of reach to the auto scaling group
  - **Unlike AZ Rebalancing** termination of unhealthy first then create the new ec2 instances
  - Elastic IP and EBs volume detached from terminated ec2 instance you manually attach them to the new ec2 instance

## Auto Scaling Policies

- in four situation ASG send the SNS email notification

  -  when a new ec2 launch

  - when terminate the ec2 

  - when failed to launch ec2 instance

  - when failed to terminate ec2 instance

    

- you can merge two ASG into single one ASG 

- AWS service sends the ec2 metrics to the cloud watch about the ASG instances

- Basic monitoring is enabled (300s ) by default and free you can do by using AWs console only

- Detailed monitoring is enabled (60s ) by default and free you can do by using AWs cli only

  

## Stand by state

- if you need some patches to you ec2 instances so you do stand by state from auto scaling group
- here there will be no health check service  and no new ec2 instance will be created for that stand by state instance
- stand by instances still managed by ASG
- They do not count towards available ec2 instance for workload/ app use

## Important point

- Auto scaling group use alarm to do action
- **for simple or step** Scaling adjustment can not change group size above max capacity or below the capacity
- **predictive scaling**  you set 5 servers increase on Monday means for future 
- **Target tracking** increase or decrease the capacity of ec2 instances based on the target set value
- **Step scaling** increase or decrease the capacity of ec2 instances based on the step declaring but here is no cool time just warm up time setting. **Do not** support wait time/ cool time
- Warm up time - Time taken by a newly launched instance to be ready and contribute to the watched metric.
-   Cool down - A time set by the user (default 300 sec.) where during this time all the alerts will be ignored
- Launch Configuration can not be edit just delete and copy

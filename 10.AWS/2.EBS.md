# Elastic Block Storage(ebs)

- its mean data is stored on the disk in the formatted of block so we say that is  **block  storage**

- There are three different types of   block storage

- it is network based storage(there is some latency to communicate)

- it allows you persist data after ec2 termination

- it can be mounted to one ec2 instance at a time

- they are bound to specific **AZ**

- Free tier is 30GB  per month

- it can be detached  from one and attached to another one

- Have provisioned capacity(**Size in GB  and IOPS**)

  - you get billed for all provisioned capacity 

  - you can change this capacity within time

  - ## EBS

  â€‹        there are three different types of ebs

  - ## SSD

    - it is solid state drive and it has two types

    - ## gp2

      - minimum storage is 1GB an maximum is 16TB
      - IOPS -16000
      - Throughput 250 Mb (means in one iops 250 mb is read or write)
      - that balances for price and performance of you web-service workload

    - ## IO1

      - minimum storage is 4GB an maximum is 16TB
      - IOPS -64000
      - Throughput 1000 Mb (means in one iops 1000 mb is read or write)
      - **For highest performance and mission critical application and low latency**

  - ## HDD

    - it is hard disk drive

    - ## st1

      - minimum is 500GB and maximum is 16TB
      - IOPS-500
      - Throughput is 500mb
      - **for lowest cost and  frequently access, throughput intensive workload**

    - ## sc1 

      - minimum is 500GB and maximum is 16TB
      - IOPS-250
      - Throughput- 250mb 
      - 
      - **for lowest cost and less frequently access, throughput  workload**

    - 

  - ## Magnetic

    - it is magnetic drive now it is not use in production
    - it s minimum is 1GB and maximum is 1TB
    - IOPS N/A
    - Throughput N/A

    

- ## EFS 

  - it is elastic file system storage

  - it can be connected to multiple ec2 instances

  - to deliver a files to multiple ec2 instances

    

- ## Ephemeral Storage(instance storage or temporary storage)

  - 

# EBS

- By default root volume for ec2 is delete on termination

- In Production you uncheck the delete on termination

- When you want to add additional volume to ec2 you must care that volume would be in same **AZ**

- ### if your volume is in different zone and you want to connect with your ec2 that is diff zone

  - first you create a snapshot of your volume and make a new volume from this snapshot 
  - then delete this snapshot and previous volume where you from make a snapshot
  - 

- ### How to attach a new volume to your ec2?

  1. first create a volume in same zone

  2. attach volume to machine

  3. formatted a new volume and mount with any directory and make it permanent and update it

     ```bash
     # formated the disk
     $ mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
     # mount with directory
     $ mount /dev/xvdf /data1
     # make it permanent by in /etc/fstab
     /dev/xvdf   /data1    defaults   0 0
     # update this 
     $ mount -a
     
     ```

     

- ### How to modify volume and then change filesystem 

  1. first modify volume through console

  2. go to machine and run this command to update this command

     ```bash
     # resize update the volume size in filesystem
     $ resize2fs /dev/xvdf
     ```

- ### How to modify  Root volume with no downtime for machine

  1. first modify volume in console of machine

  2. then rum these commands

     ```bash
     $ growpart /dev/xvda 1
     $ xfs_growfs -d /
     ```

- ### Concept about EBS IOPS GP2

  - in gp2  minimum is 1GB and maximum is 16TB  

  - 1-33.3 GB volume  will give   100 IOPS

  - after 33.3 GB will give every 3 IOPS on 1GB increase

  - at 5334 GB will give 16000 IOPS  no more IOPS increase even if you increase size of volume

    - ## burstable

      - it is credit or remaining IOPS that AWS will give if you have heavy load so it will increase your normal IOPS 
      - it can give you 3000 IOPS as burstable means for **1000GB** 

- ### Concept about EBS IOPS IO1     

  -  in IO1  there is ratio 50:1  means every 1GB You will get 50 IOPS

  -  minimum IOPS are 100

- ### Concept about EBS HDD

  - no IOPS 
  - it based on throughput like 40mb will write and read base on IOPS

- ## PRICING ABOUT EBS

  -  30GB is free tier

- ## if your boss says i need 32000 iops  in the domain of gp2 

  - so we use **RAID 0** CONCEPT MAKE IT

- ## How to Reduce Size of ebs volume to 5gb

  - first create a volume of size five
  - second format and mount with filesystem with any directory
  - third sync data of 10gb volume t o5gb volume then delete it

- ## Ephemeral Storage(Instance store)

  -  it is temporary storage
  -  **If you need high performance disk then use instance store which is physically attached to ec2 instance**
  -  **ec2-support instance store** can used instance store 
  -  **For buffer/cache/temporary content** is to used instance store 
  -  **Backup** is your responsibility
  -  its data will be deleted when you do terminate or stop
  -  these can not be deployed on this storage

     - ubuntu

     - redhat,centos and Window
  -  only amazon images can be deployed on instance store
  -  **SAA hardware for better performance and no critical data and no problem for data loss**
  -  

- ## EBS SNAPSHOT

  -  it is point image of copy of your ebs volume
  -  any data written after snapshot will include in snapshot
  -  it is incremental snapshot what ever changes occur it will just make snap shot of ebs
  -  you can make a 5000 ebs volume per aws account  and 10000 snapshot per aws account
  -  this snapshot is stored in any s3 bucket but you do not know where it is located
  -  **ebs are A-Z specific  but Snapshot are Region** based
  -  you can create a ebs from snapshot with same size or larger size from original size of ebs where you make snapshot
  -  if you want to make a complete snapshot of your ebs volume then you must unmount not boot volume or non root volume so be careful and you can get volume during snapshot process
  -  if you want to make a complete snapshot of your **root volume** so you must  stop ec2 instance
  -  if you delete previous snapshot then aws first copy data of previous snapshot and put the data into the snapshot no 2 so it is incremental and data recovery process
  -  snapshot are stored in s3 bucket
  -  first snapshot is clone and other snapshot are subsequently

  - snapshot are stored in s3 bucket
  - first snapshot is clone and other snapshot are subsequently    

- ## EBS encryption

  - if you make volume from encrypted snapshot so it will be encrypted ebs volume and vice versa 
  - you can encrypt the ebs volume at the rest there are many ways to encrypt the data like tools, encryption at the OS level  and encrypt at the application level and you make encrypt at the filesystem
  - **encryption must be on the side of ec2**
  - you can encrypt the root volume by default at the time ec2 instance creating
  - you can encrypt the snapshot of not encrypt ebs at the making of copying the data
  - you can not make a public encrypted snapshot 
  - you can no share with another account until you give permission but you make share if you have no default CMK

# How to attach multiple ebs volumes

- you have to select type of ebs must be (Provisioned iops SSD(iop2))

# EBS- multi-attach

- you can attach multiple ec2 instance to the same ebs volume in the same **AZ**
- Each ec2 instance has full permission to read and write
- **Use Case**
  - Achieve higher application availability 
  - Application must manage concurrent  data

- Must use file system that **cluster-aware** not(**use xfs,ext4 like**)

# EFS

- managed nfs can be mounted to multiple ec2 instance at a time
- It can work in multi **AZ**
- **High available, scalable and expensive(3x of gp2) pay per use**
- **Use Case**
  - content delivery to multiple ec2 instance
  - just you can attach with linux

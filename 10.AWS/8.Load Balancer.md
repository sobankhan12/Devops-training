# Load Balancer

- it is used to balance traffic between different ec2 machines

- to balance traffic to the available server

- it is region specified 

- load balancer support ip4  address in VPC

- To ensure that the ELB has scales nodes in multi AZ and subnets defined at least **/27** in CIDR size. you must reserve 8 IPS for ELB nodes to scaling.

- There are 5 ip are reserve in aws  first four and last

  - one for base network

  - one for vpc router

  - one for DNS hosting

  - one for  future

  - last for broadcast network

    

- for **fault tolerance** you must ensure to distribute all registered ec2 instances in all **AZ** within vpc and if possible then distribute the same amount of ec2 instances in all **AZ** 

- load balancer check health of all registered ec2 instances within time and then declare healthy and unhealthy

- By default aws use  console **ping http at port 80** and ec2 must respond back with the message of **200 OK** otherwise elb declare it as unhealthy

- Response time-out is by default is **5s but range is 2-60s**

- Time check interval is **30s but can be range 5-300s**

- Unhealthy Threshold is **2 but can be range 2-10**

- Healthy Threshold is **5 but can be range 2-10**

- elb name must be unique in your account

- you can select only one subnet in each AZ

- ELB is accessed through DNS but not with ip

- You need one pubic subnet in each AZ so that elb will be able to route traffic to internet

- ## Public and internal load balancer 

  - format of Public ELB will be look like this

    - sobanloading-1234567890-us-east1-elb.amazon.com
  - format of Internal ELB will be look like this
    - internal-soban-loading-123456789-us-east1-elb-amazon-com

- ## Cross-zone_load balancing

  -  By default our elb send the traffic across the multi AZ without caring how much the ec2 instances in each AZ just it balance the traffic on AZ 
  - By default cross-zone is disabled  when you enable the cross-zone then the traffic will be balancing according to **AZ and with the number of ec2 in  the AZ**

- ## APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER

  - it works specially for application it present on the 7th layer of osi model
  - it support http, https

- 

- ## Network Load Balancer

  - it works on the 4th layer of osi model layer is transport layer it support TCP,UDP and TLS
  - if you need low latency so you network load balancer
  - Here you use always private IPS of instances
  - less latency 100ms vs 400ms of ALB
  - NLB has one static ip per **AZ** and support elastic ip 
  - it is used for high performance

- ## Classic Load Balancer

  - it work both layer 4th and 7th layer and it support http, https, TCP.

- ## Hostname

  - it is connected with you load balancer like abc.example.com, song.example.com

    

- ## WAF

  - it is used to set rules for your traffic like if traffic come from specific country you blocked it 
  - if traffic come from this ip thousands time within time period you block it
  - so you can exactly set rules for your application

- ## Listener

  - its function is determined which type of url is hitting by users and then transfer that traffic to the specified target group machines

  - Like if someone is hitting software.example.com so it transfer the traffic to the group of software ec2 machines and if someone hit song.example.com so it will divert the traffic to the song target group ec2 machines

    

- ## Cross-zone load balancing

  - each load balancer instance distributes evenly across all instances in all **AZ**
  - in **ALB** is always on(Can not be disabled)
    - no charge for inter zone
  - in **NLB** Disabled by default (can you enable it) and you will be charge for inter zone
  - in **ELB** enabled by default  and you will be no charge for inter zone
- ## Default group

  - it is used to when user does not specify group so listener transfer the traffic to the default group

- ## Health Check

  - it is run every time to check the health of ec2 instance if health is not good so it will transfer the traffic to other user

-  ## Stickiness

  - it is used when user come with same ip within period of time so it will create a session with the specified ec2 instance 
  - minimum time is 1s-7days
  - Like if i set stickiness 45s if users come multiple time within 45s so i will attach or create a session with one ec2 instance but if come after 45s so i divert the traffic to the other side of ec2 instance
  - so you can be saved from DDOS Attack

- ## Connection-Draining

  - it is used when a administrator stop ec2 instance while some user is doing some task like he is doing some transaction so connection-draining will not stop ec2-instance with the specified time and no new user will access this ec2 instance

  - Default time is 300s(5 minutes) but you can increase it 

    

- ## Path base Routing and host base Routing

  - abc.example.com/song is Path base routing 
  - song.example.com is host base routing 
  - so host base routing is best than path base routing
  =======

  - song.example.com is host base routing 
  
  - so host base routing is best than path base routing
  
    

## Interview Question

- #### which service is used for fault tolerance and high availability?

  - Load balancer and  autoscaling group

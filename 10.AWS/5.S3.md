# s3

- it is simple storage service and we use it for backup and archive.

- its SLA(service level agreement) is 99.999999999% and size is unlimited

- if you want to share document with others so you make it public must and then it will be available

- **max object size is 5TB**

- if file size is more than **5gb** you use multi-part upload

- 

    

## if you want to connect s3 with window you use  tnt drive software

## if you want to connect s3 with linux you use s3fs

## if you enable version it will make version of each file

## you can host a static website through s3  and can redirect to specific website 

## if you want to accelerate a download speed you use s3 acceleration

## you can give a solution to on premises data to aws to use s3 acceleration 

## if you want if someone to download data from your s3  so he pay charges so you can set requester pays enable

## you can use one zone for secondary backup

## if you want to access data from glaciers so first you restore data within days and time after approval of request your data will be available in one zone  within that you select when you were restoring after all of that you can download that data

# LIFE CYCLE RULE

- here you explain how data moves from one storage class to another class and when data will be from last storage like e.g after 10 years data will be expire and data will be remove from s3 bucket
- 

## What are the factors on which s3 billings happens?

- how much data(GB) you store on s3

- charge based on storage class

- how much is going out from your bucket

- the amount of request happens on your s3 bucket

- request put object, get object, delete object

- #### inbound data is free and outbound 1GB data is free

  

## S3 cross region replication

- it is used to replica data on other region bucket to save data from natural disaster recovery
- you must enable versioning on both bucket 
- only new objects will be replicated
- 

## S3 Cross Account Access

it is mostly used in larger companies

## Snowball

- There are the three types of snowball. snowball is service for s3 big data to transfer from local to aws and vice versa.
- **Snowball** is used just to copy data from local to aws and data capacity is some terabyte 
- **Snowball edge** is used to copy data of **100 Terabyte** and it is used for computing and to install ec2 instances on this service
- **Snowmobile ** is like a truck to move data like ex-terabyte from local to aws
- You have to make request job to acquire this device

# S3 Acceleration 

- it is used to increase the speed of download and upload speed of s3 objects
- it is not in free tier service
- you can test the speed through s3 acceleration speed comparison 
- you can use s3 browser for connecting s3 in your laptop
- you can fast glacier software to test glacier storage class
- 

# S3 inventory 

- it is used to collect information of s3 objects

- what is status of replication and how much data is going and coming

- it is best to get information about your s3 bucket 

- and to trigger any event base on the report

- you can set value daily or weekly

- one folder will be created in you bucket

  

  

# How to see the which files are replicating

- you have to go configuration of an object that you will see that these files are replicated 

# S3 MFA

- **S3 MFA for **
  - permanently delete object version
  - suspended versioning of bucket

- **S3 NOT MFA Required**
  - listing deleting objects
  - enabling versioning of s3 bucket

- only bucket owner can do enable MFA on s3

- you must be root account for s3 MFA enable/disable

- MFA-delete currently can be done through **AWS CLI**

- How to do that

  ```bash
  $ aws configure --profile soban252
  # now enable mfa
  $ aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket "bucket-name" --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "copy of your mfa device in security credential" mfa-code "code on your device"
  # now disable mfa
  $ aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket "bucket-name" --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled MFADelete=Disabled --mfa "copy of your mfa device in security credential" mfa-code "code on your device"
  ```

  

# S3 encryption

- One way to force encryption is to make bucket policy that every object should be encrypted before uploading to s3 bucket

- other ways you can set up on the bucket level

  - **Amazon S3 SSE-S3**

  - **AWS key management service(SS3-KMS)**

    

# S3 Access Logs

- Any request made to my bucket from any account authorized or denied to stored in another bucket
- to make analytic development on s3 bucket
- **you never make same bucket for logging**
- first go into bucket and go to properties and go down to server access logs and then paste name of logging bucket
- 

# S3 Pre-singed URLS

- Can generate pre-singed URL by using CLI or CDK
  - For download(easy, use cli)
  - For upload (harder, use CDK)

- Valid for **3600s** and you can change time of expired --expire-in [TIME_BY_SECONDS]

- User inherit permission from the person who generated pre-signed URLS for PUT/GET

- **EXAMPLES**

  - only logged-in users can download premium videos

  - Allow a temporarily to any user to upload files in our bucket

    ```bash
    # in aws cli
    $ aws s3 presign s://"bucketname/object" --expires-in "time" --my-region
    
    ```

    

#  S3 Storage classes

- **S3 Standard**
  - high availability  99.99% 

# S3 analytics

- you can setup s3 analytic to help determine when to transition objects from one storage class to another
- **Does not work for One_zone and Glacier**
- Report is updated on daily basis but first report 24 to 48 hours
- it work best with lifecycle rule management

# S3 Performance

- ### S3 Baseline Performance

- - amazon automatically scales highest request rates latency 200-300ms
- - your application can get at least **3500** PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and **5500** for HEAD/GET per second in one prefix in bucket 
- - no limit of prefixes in bucket



- ### S3 KMS Limitation

  - if you use SSE-KMS  then you can be impacted by the KMS limit

  - Count towards the KMS quota per second **(5500, 10,000, 30,000 based on the region)**

  - you can increase your limit by service quota console

    

- ### S3 Performance

  - **Multipart Upload**

    - recommended for files > 100MB
    - must use for files >=5GB
    - it help to upload files parallely

  - **S3 Transfer acceleration**

    - increase transfer speed by transferring file to AWS edge location which forward the file to s3 bucket in the target region

    - compatible with multipart-upload

    - **example my file in USA and i want to transfer this file to Australia region so my file will go AWS edge location in USA through public internet and then this file move to Australia region with private net of Aws. So this process fast transfer my file**

      

  - **S3 Byte-range Fetches**
  
    - parallelize Gets by requesting specific byte range
    - Better resilience in case of failure
    - can be used to speed up downloads
    - can be used to retrieve only partial part of file like (Head of file)
    - or you can set First 200 Byte of file is to be download

# S3 Select and Glacier Select

- Retrieve less data using SQL by performing server-side  filtering
- can filter by rows and column (simple SQL)
- less network, CPU

# S3 Requester Pays

- the requester pays for whatever he downloads from my bucket

- Helpful when you want to share a large data with other account

- The requester must be authenticated by **AWS**(can not be anonymous)

  

# AWS Athena

- it is server less technology to perform analytics directly with s3 files
- use SQL to query files
- Has OBDC driver
- charge per query and charge per data scanned
- support CSV,JSON
- **Use cases** like, Business analytics, VPC flow, ELB logs, Cloud trails 
- **Exam tip** analyze data directly on s3 => Aws Athena 

# S3 vault Policy and Glacier Vault Lock

- ### Glacier Vault Lock

  - Adopt a WORM (Write once and read many)
  - lock policies for future edits
  - Helpful compliance and data retention

- ### S3 Object lock(enable versioning)

  - Adopt a WORM (Write once and read many)
  - block an object version deletion for a specific time
  - object retention
    - retention period
    - legal hold no specific time perion
  - **Modes**

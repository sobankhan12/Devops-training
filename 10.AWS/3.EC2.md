EC2 INSTANCES

- ## Families

  - there are five types of families
    - General purpose is used for deploying or small testing application
    - **Compute** is used for where we required a high CPU utilization is required like gaming and processing, ad serving, video encoding, gaming, scientific modelling, distributed analytics, and CPU-based machine learning inference.
    - **Memory** is used for where we required a Ram utilization. Memory-intensive applications such as open-source databases, in-memory caches, and real time big data analytics
    - **Accelerated Computing** is used where Machine learning, high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, seismic analysis, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and drug discovery.
    - **storage optimized** [NoSQL databases](https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/) (e.g. Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis), in-memory databases (e.g. Aerospike), scale-out transactional databases, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, analytics workloads. 

- ## Types

  - there are few types like  A, T2 and T3

    - t2.micro and t2.xlarge

      

- ### I want a ec2 machine that would be general purpose and it would be 30GB Ram and its model number ?

  - first go to google search for ec2 instance type s that you can search for exact if not so that you can say it is 32GB its model number is t2.2xlarge

    


- ## if i have an ec2 instance that size is 1GB RAM but i want increase its size to 8GB how would to tackle it?

  - yes it is possible 

  - first you have to stop instance and go instance setting and change instance size

    

- ## On Demand Instances

  - price schedule

    - Each partial instance-hour consumed is billed per-second for instances launched in Linux, Windows, SQL Server, and Ubuntu. You will be charged minimum for 60 seconds
    - Each partial instance-hour is billed as a full hour for all other instance types.

  - you have to which hours you  use

  - partially hours converted into full hours

  - no capacity guarantee

  - not use in production

  - use for testing purpose

    

- ## Reserved Instances

  - **PRICE**

    - you will get 75% off if you standard class
    - if you use convertible class you can get discount

  - capacity guarantee

  - two terms (1 year and 3 years) and best for long term instance planning

  - you can get 75% discount on ec2 reserved

  - there are three payment options that you can choose for your instance 

  - no upfront, partial upfront and full upfront

  - no cancellation but AWS give you facility to resell your instance

  - offering class means you can convert your model of ec2 or not e.g convertible and standard

    

- ## Scheduled Reserved instance

  - there was drawback in reserved instances 
  - so here you can reserved instance with your time and 
  - for developer you have to schedule a instance with your time

- ## Spot Instances

  - it is more cheaper than and here we use bidding 

  - if someone give more amount than you AWS will give this instance to other person

  - now you can reserve this instance up to 6 hours

  - it is mostly used in auto scaling time

  - we use this in production environment

    

- ## Dedicated  Instance

  - in the hypervisor only my instance will run even if the space is empty   
  - we use this because in the previous instances there were some drawbacks like security, latency and privacy
  - they will charge $2 dollar for your dedicated hypervisor
  - but you can run multiple instance in hypervisor but you will charge only one time for hypervisor

- ## Dedicated Hosts

  - AWS will assign you full  host.

  - you have to setup your own hypervisor and and run instances how much you want

  - you will charged for only host means hardware 

  - ### if client say we want to bind application license with hardware means mac address  so you have to such solution that we do not need to configure application license binding 

  - so we used Dedicated Host

- ## Launch instance template

  - it is time saving you configure all all configuration in the template
  - whenever you need so you just launch this template
  - it is very useful and easy for that person that does not know about instance so he just go over there and just launch this template   

- ## Capacity Reservation

  - it is used to reserve the space to launch your instance 
  
  - you have to pay for  capacity not  for instance and you do not need to stuck in que
  
  - so you acquire a capacity and you have to run on demand instance
  
    

- ### EC2 User Data

  - it is possible to bootstrap our ec2 instances with using ec2 user data script
  
  - you can say pre starting installation of software on ec2 install
  
  - it runs for first time
  
  - installing updates, software, loading files and permission
  
    
  
- ## exam question

  - if in examination ebs backed ec2 instance means ebs is root volume where our instance is installed
  - instance store backed ec2 means it will be root volume
  - how to get metadata of ec2 linux machine
    - curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata
    - curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata/instance-id

# Placement Group

- **Rack Server** is dedicated computer and used to be as server and designed to be installed in a framework is called rack server

- **Cluster Placement Group** 

  - all instances put in the same rack. if the rack fails all instances will be fail

  - it is best for high performance

  - it is not best for high availability

    

- **Spread Placement Group**

  - each instance is put in the distinct rack. each rack has one instance

  - if one rack fails means one instance fail. other instances will be not effected

  - It is best for high availability but not best for High performance applications because each instance is apart from each other

  - **Benefits**

    - Good for deploying applications that have a smaller number of instances. You can have at most 7 instances per AZ in the group
    - The group can span multiple AZs in the same region.

    

- **Partition Placement Group**
  - each logical partition within placement group has its own rack
  - if rack fails it will effect multiple instances on that rack within logical partition group
  - So, if you have replication in other partitions, then your data will be safe. 
  - This placement group strikes a balance between High Performance and High Availability.
  - This will be good for Big data applications like HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka, etc.
  - which needs High Performance, but must also be Fault Tolerant at the same time.
  - **Benefits of Partition placement group**
    -  Each partition within a PG has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and power source.
    -  Good for deploying large distributed and replicated workload. 
    - There are at most 7 partitions in each AZ, but the number of instances in each partition is limited only by the account limits.
    - Offer visibility into the partitions
    - Partitions can be in different AZs in the same region

# Elastic Network Interface

- it is logical component in a vpc that represent a virtual network card
- ENI has different following attributes
  - Primary private ipv4  and one or more secondary 
  - one elastic ip4 for one primary ipv4
  - one public ipv4
  - one or more security groups
  - a mac address 

- you can attach ENI to the fly instance for failover
- Bound to specific availability zones

# EC2 Hibernate

- The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
- next time instance boot faster
- **Under the Hood** the state of in-memory is saved in encrypted root volume
- The root volume must be encrypted
- **USE CASES**
  - long-running process
  - saving RAM state
  - service that take time to intialize

- **Supported instance families** like C,R,M type
- **Instance Size** must be less than 150GB
- **Volume** must be encrypted ebs not instance store
- **Available** for on-demand and reserved instance
- **Instance** can not be more hibernated more than 60 days

# EC2 Nitro

- underlaying platform for the next generation of ec2 instance
- new virtualization technology
- **Allows for better performance**
  - high networking speed
  - high speed EBS (Nitro is necessary to 640,00 IOPS but for non-nitro is 32,000)

- Better underlaying security

- **Instance** type are C,D,G,M

- **Bare metal instance** are a,c5.metal

- **SAA** related Question which instance is better for max iops answer is **Ec2 Nitro**

   

# EC2 Vcpu

- multiple threads on one  vcpu

- **Change vcpu** you can change vcpu according to your need

- **SAA** this type of question come in your exam according to cost licensing question

- **only specified** on launch time

  

# EC2 Capacity Reservation

- it ensure that you have capacity for your ec2 launch in your specific **AZ**
- No need for 1 or 3 years commitment
- Capacity access is immediate billing will starts because you have reserve 

# AMI

- it is amazon machine image

- you customize AMI according your web-service(httpd, nginx)

- faster boot

- **Specified Region** they are build for specific region but(you can copy from one region to another region)

  

# EC2 Metadata

- info about your ec2 instance

-  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data

### How to use ec2 instance without pem file

```bash
# first login in ec2 with pem file
# generate passwd for root
$ passwd root
# go this file and change these line like this
$ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
permit root login yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
# now login without pem file like this
$ ssh root@3.80.107.181


```

### How to false DeleteOnTermination policy on ebs volumes on running ec2-instance

```bash
# you can do it by using cli command

```

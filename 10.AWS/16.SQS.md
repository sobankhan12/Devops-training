# Amazon SQS

- it is oldest service of aws(10 years old)
- Fully managed service to **Decouple applications**
- **Attributes**
  - unlimited numbers of throughput and unlimited numbers of messages in que
  - period of retention is **min: 4 days and max: 14 days**
  - low latency(<10ms)
  - Limitation of message is 256KB

- can have duplicate messages
- can have our of order messages
- **Producer(produce message)===>SQS===> Consumer(that say hey SQS have you message for me)**
- Produces SQS using SDK
- The message is persistent in SQS until consumer delete it during retention period
- Consumers could be **ec2 instance, servers, Lambda function**
- consumer can get 10 messages at a time from SQS
- if consumer do not delete messages this message can be leak to others
- **SQS to decouple between application tiers**

# SQS visibility

- After a message is pulled out by consumer so during this time this message will be invisible to others consumers
- By default visibility time out is **30s** . the message has to be processed by consumer
- if message is no processed during this visibility so message go back que and other consumer will processed **remember if you not delete this message**
- and it will be processed twice by the same consumer or other consumer
- A consumer could call the **Change Message Visibility API** to get more time for process
- if time is too low so we get messages in more number

# SQS Dead Letter Que

- we can set threshold how many time messages go back to que
- **it is best for Debugging**
- when our app is crashed or fail loop so we do no want to put back message into que so we want to send in Dead letter que
- we set retention period to see bug of our application (**like 14 days**)
- **We make dead letter que service and and then go back to application SQS service and configure it**
- 

# SQS Request Response system

- to implement this process: **SQS Temporary Que Client**

- it leverages virtual ques instead of creating / deleting SQS Ques (**it is also cost effective**)

  

# SQS Delay Que

- Delay a message (**consumer can not see message immediately **) up to 15 minutes.
- Default 0 seconds for Delay Que.
-  you can set it to up to 15 minutes
- Can override the default time on the sending message time

# FIFO QUE

- first in first out(ordering of messages in que)
- Limited throughput: **300 msg/s and without batching and with the batching 3000 msg/s**
- Exactly once send (removing duplicates)
- Messages are processed by consumers in also ordered 

# SQS with auto scaling

- first we create alarm with custom metric will be (**Que length**)
- then we create another alarm for our auto scaling group
- if value of message que length increase so it will trigger our auto scaling alarm and in this new ec2 instances will be created to do this job
- 

# SQS+SNS Fan out

- push once in SNS topic receive all message from SNS topic in all SQS which are subscribers this SNS
- Fully decoupled : no data loss
- ability to add more SQS to SNS subscribers
- **Make sure your SQS access policy is used to write SNS topic**
- 

# SQS FIFO+ SNS FIFO= Fan out

- in case you need fan out + ordering+ deduplication

# IAM

- IAM is a identity and access management is web service that helps you securely control access to aws sources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated and to authorized to use you aws resources
- AWS strongly recommend that you do not use aws root account for daily tasks evenly for administrative ones
- IAM users limit is **5000** per aws account
- You can add **10** users at a time
- IAM user can be members of maximum **10** Groups
- IAM group limit is **300** per aws account
- IAM Roles limit is **1000** per aws account
- Default limit of managed policy attached with user or iam role is **10**
- You can assign **two** aws access and secret key to one user

## Features of IAM

- shared access to your aws account
- **Granular Permission** means you give some specific permission to specific type of permission
- Secure access to aws resource for you application that running on aws ec2 instances
- Multifactor authentication
- **Identity Federation** means you can access some resources with authentication through Facebook or github id without creating a new account
- Identity information for assurance means that which person what did with my aws resources
- **PCI-DSS** means it safe your credit information
- Free to use you have to freely use to it  

## Special Term in IAM

- ### Principal

  - it can be user, federated user or application that is requesting to perform a task
  - you administrative user will be first principal

- ### Request

  - when a principal do a request to do something on aws resources
  - it can be through aws console, cli or api
  - The request containing following **action, resource, principal, environment data(email,password,ip), resource data(ec2, s3)**

- ### Authentication

  - whenever a principal try do some action so it would be authenticated first(email, password)
  - authentication can be through email, secret key, access key through cli or multifactor authentication

- ### Authorization

  - what permission should be assigned to that specific principal like it can do action on (ec2, s3)

  - IAM policies are stored in JSON format for IAM user or application

    

## Identity Federation

- to give access to aws resources through your company email and password has been assigned you and you do not need to create account on the aws
- you can federate those users through identities in aws
- Those users can do work on aws
- **Federation is useful in these cases**
  - your users have identities in you corporate directory
  - If your corporate Directory is compatible Security Assertion Markup Language (**SAML(2.0)**)
  -  If your corporate Directory is **not** compatible Security Assertion Markup Language (**SAML(2.0)**) so you can use **Identity Broker Application** for federation to use aws

- **Internet Provider**
  - like Facebook, Google, Git hub you can access the aws with the credentials of these application account no need to create a separate account in aws separately 
  - Here you use Open ID Correct **(OIDC)** instead of **(SAML)**

## Permission and Policy

- you set permission for your user that what he can do in your aws account 
- by default IAM user has no permission to do any thing
- you give him permission to that user by policy or assigning a role to him
- **By Default federated users are assigned role** . They have permission with these rules
- You set policies on the group also
- One user can have **one role** at a time 

## Resource Base Policy

- you set policy on the resources that who user can do action on that resource like (ec2 creation, s3 listing)
- you make list of that users can do action on that resources
- other users will be denied to perform action on that resources
- Roles has no credential it is a created dynamically and these are temporarily 



## Difference between Role base Policy and Resource  base Policy

- Unlike a role base Policy, Resource base Policy specifies that who can access this resource
- while using cross-account resources we set resource base policy on the trusting account(ec2 on resource account) and role base policy base on the trusted account user(developer account user)
- We use resource base policy where we want our iam user do no left his previous role mostly on the cross account resource accessing
- One user can have one role at a time 

## IAM Role Delegation

- it is trust between two account one account will  be trusted account (Requester) and other will be trusting account(Accepter or resource account) 
- when one account user need some action to perform on the resources of other account so we create delegation between two account we assign Resource base policy that user of other account can do action on my resource account
- we make trust policy and permission policy

## Resource base policy resources

- Amazon s3 
- simple notification service
- Amazon glacier vault
- Amazon simple que service

## Cross Access Account Access using IAM Role

- Login in furqan account 
- create a group dev and make two users(user1, user2) and add them into dev group
- Attach a policy ec2Read only access to dev group
- Login into second account(abdulmanan) 
- create 1 s3 bucket
- create a role name s3role
- attach a policy with role ==> another aws account==>insert id of furqan and s3 read only access
- now login back to furqan account
- click on the group ==>permission==>inline policy==>aws security token service==>assume role==>click on "Add statement"==>apply policy
- Now login iam user1 of furqan account
- now click on switch role and see can you switch and see s3 bucket of another aws account(abdulmanan)
- repeat this process with IAM user2
- Now login in abdulmanan account and go role==>trusted relationship==>edit==>paste ARN of user1==>update policy
- Now login user1 and switch role and test s3 bucket
- Now login user2 and switch role and you will see error  due to trusted relationship

## MFA

- it is more secure way to secure your root account

- MFA=you know password+you have a device 

- MFA options can be **Virtual MFA(google authenticator), Universal 2 Factor security key(yubi key), **

  

## IAM Access Advisor

- shows service permission granted to user and when these service last time accessed by a user 
- it is best to revise your IAM Policies
- Last accessed information is available for EC2, IAM, Lambda, and S3 management actions

This is the abbreviation of identity access management. It is controlled by root or owner this aws  account.

you can secure your connection with MFA (multi factor authentication) 

- ### If your mobile is lost and you have set MFA for your account then what solution come

  these are safety rules

  - first make screen shot of your QR code so that you make MFA on other device
  - go through command line mode and disable MFA authentication 

- ## How to secure a root  account in both side like aws console and command line 

  - first you make a strong password and MFA authentication and delete all secret and access keys on root account

- ## you have to create a user that can terminate, stop and start the specific instance like dev-server?

  -  i will create policy with these condition like ec2 start, stop and terminate but give the specific resource
  - arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:account id:**`instance`**/instance_id

# IAM ROLE

- it is used to make a connection between services

- it is also used to allow user to cross account project work

# Kinesis Overview

- Makes it easy to collect, process and analyze  streaming data in real time
- ingest real time data is: **Application logs, Metric , Website clickstreams**
- **Kinesis Data Streams**: capture, store and process data streams
- **Kinesis Data Firehose**: load data streams in aws data store
- **Kinesis Data analytics**: to analyze data streams with SQL 
- **Kinesis video Streams**: to capture, process and store video streams

# Kinesis Data Streams

- billing will be on per shard .and you make shards as much you want
- retention period will be 1 to 365 days
- Ability to reprocess data (replay)
- Once data is inserted in kinesis it can not be deleted(immutability)
- Data that shares the same partition will go to the same shard
- Producer: AWS SDK, kinesis agent, kinesis produce library(KPL), 
- Consumers:
  - AWS managed: Lambda, kinesis firehose, kinesis data analytics
  - custom: KCL(kinesis custom library), SDK

# Kinesis Data Firehose

- Serverless no administration , full automation
- AWS: Redshift, / Amazon S3/ Elastic Search
- 3rd Party: splunk, DynamoDB
- pay per data goes through firehose
- **Near real time**
  - 60 seconds latency for non full batches
  - minimum 32Mb data at a time

- Supports many data like SQL, 
- Support custom data transformation through lambda
- ALL data go for backup in S3, copy to redshift

# Kinesis Data analytics

- to perform real time analytics on kinesis Streams using sql

- fully managed, automatic scaling, real time analytics, 

- pay for actual consumption

- **Use cases**

  - time-series analytic

  - real-time dashboard

  - real-time metrics

    

# Amazon Mq

- managed apache ActiveMQ
  - Amazon Mq is much scalable like sqs, sns

- MQ has both SQS and SNS
- high availability

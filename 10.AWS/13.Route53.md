# Route 53

- It is used to route traffic to towards your resource like ec2

- it check health of your ec2 instance

- ### TTL(time to live)

  - when client request to dns to access our website so dns hey please cache this result 
  - this cache time can be between **1m to 2 days recommended**
  - if client request many time in this **TTL**  he will get result from cache

- **High TTL**
  - less traffic toward route 53
  - possibly outdated record

- **Less TTL**
  - more traffic toward route 53
  - more billing 
  - updated records 

# Alias Record

- Maps hostname to aws resources
- an extension of DNS functionality
- alias record are always type of A/AAAA
- you can not set TTL for alias it is set by default
- **Alias Record Targets**
  - cloud front, s3 website, elastic balancer, elastic beanstalk, Global accelerator, vpc endpoint
  - you set dns of **ec2 instance**

# Simple Routing

- route the traffic to the single resource
- if multiple resource but it will route the traffic to the random instance is chosen to response back
- if alias is enabled then you point only resource
- Can not be associated health check

# Weighted Routing Policy

- route traffic % to the specific resource
- like we want to send traffic  70% to web1-server and 20% to the web2-server and 10% to the web3-server
- we use it in testing load of application on the specific resource

# Health Check

- http health check only for public resources
- **Health Check**
  - health check that monitor endpoint(servers)
  - health check that monitor other health check (calculated health check)

- About 15 health checker will check health health point of the end

- health check pass only if the success code is 2xx or 3xx

- can monitor up to 256 child health check(calculated health check) into one single parent

  

# Failover Routing 

- if primary server crash or unhealth so we route traffic to secondary server
- 

# Geolocation Routing

- this is based on the user location
- Should create Default record if no other record match
- 

# Geo proximity

- to shift traffic from one region to another region  by using bias
- north America people go to my India resources like ec2 machines
- On base **bias** you can route more traffic to single resource and less traffic to other region

# Multi-value 

- Use when routing to multiple resources
- can be associated with health check (so that only healthy resources come to return back)
- Up to  8 health record can return back to multiple value query
- Multi value is not substitute for having an **ELB**

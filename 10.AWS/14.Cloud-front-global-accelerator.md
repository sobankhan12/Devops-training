# Cloud Front

- Content delivery network
- it cache data in edge location of AWS
- user first time access data with cloud front and data will be cache on edge location and new user from same location he will get data from edge location instead of s3 bucket
- 

# Cloud Front signed URLS / signed cookies

- allow access to path no matter region
- Account key-Pair only root can manage
- can filter by path, IP, date expiration
- can leverage cache features
- **S3 signed URL**
  - issue a request who issue the pre signed URL
  - Uses the IAM key of the signing the IAM Principal
  - limited lifetime

# Cloud Front Pricing

- cost per edge and it vary according to need
- **Three Price Classes**
  - Price class **ALL**: All edge location and most performance
  - Price class **200**: most regions but excludes the most expensive regions
  - Price class **100** : only less price region includes

# Cloud Front Multiple Origin

- to route to different types of ec2 instance so we use multiple origin
- like on path base **/images, /api**
- 

# cloud Front Origin Groups

- to increase high availability
- one origin will be primary and other will be secondary
- if primary region is failed so traffic will go to replication bucket
- 

# Cloud Front Field Level Encryption

- protect user sensitive information through application stack
- it provides extra security level to application
- data will be encrypt at the edge location close to user
- use asymmetric encryption 
- **Usage**
  - specific set of fields in POST request  that you want to be encrypted
  - specify the public key to encrypt

# UNICAST VS ANYCAST

- **Unicast**
  - all servers has unique IP address 

- **Any Cast**
  - all the servers has the same IP address if request come so user will be redirect to nearest server

# AWS Global Accelerator

- leverage the AWS internal network to route to your application
- 2 any cast IP are generated for your application
- any cast send traffic to aws edge location
- then edge location send traffic to your application
- **it works with Elastic IP, ALB, NLB, EC2 public or private ip**
- **Consistent Performance**
  - intelligent routing to lowest latency
  - prevent from DDOS attack
  - No issue with client cache
  - AWS internal network

- **Health Checks**
  - Great for disaster recovery
  - Helps make your application failover

- **Security**
  - only 2 External IPS will be whitelisted
  - 

# AWS Cloud Front vs Global Accelerator

- both use edge location

- both integrate with aws shield to protect from DDOS attack

- **Cloud front**

  - improve performance for both cacheable content(images,videos) and dynamic content like (API)

  - Content is served at the Edge location

    

- **Global Accelerator**

  - improved performance for wide range of application over TCP and UDP
  - Good for non-HTTP use case **Gaming, IOT, voice over IP**
  - Good for HTTP use case that require **Static IP**
  - Good for HTTP use case that require fast, regional failover

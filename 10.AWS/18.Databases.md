# Database Types

- **RDBMS**: (SQL/OPTP)  RDS,AURORA best for join and tables
- **NOSQL**: DynamoDB (json), Elastic cache(key value pair)
- **Object S3**: for big objects, Glaciers(backup/archives)
- **Data Warehouse**:(SQL analytic / BI) Redshift(OLAP),Athena
- **Search**: Elastic search(json) free text or unstructured searches
- **Graphs**: Neptune , display relationships between data

# RDS

- Managed Postgress/ MYSQL, SQL, ORACLE,

- Must provision ec2 and ebs volume for that

- Security through IAM, security groups,SSL,KMS

- Backup / snapshot point in time recovery

- Support read Replica and Multi AZ 

- Monitoring through cloud watch

- maintenance window and schedule time for maintenance

- **Use Case**: store Relation database(RDBMS/OLTP), Perform SQL queries, transactional inserts, update and delete

- ### RDS For Solution Architect

  - **Operations**: small down time when failover, read replicas, scaling, ebs snapshot, ec2 instances
  - **Security**: our responsibility for KMS,security groups, SSL,KMS and aws responsibility is to secure OS security
  - **Reliability**: Multi AZ feature , failover in case of failure
  - **Performance**: depend upon ec2 instance, add read replicas , auto-scaling for ebs volume and manual scaling of ec2 instance

# Aurora

- Compatible API for Postgress /MYSQL

- Data is held in 6 replicas in 3 Availability zones

- auto healing capability

- auto scaling for read replicas ,multi AZ

- Aurora can be Global for DR(Disaster recovery) latency purposed

- auto scaling of storage from 10GB 128TB

- Read replicas goes to 15 in Region as compared to RDS(5 in region)

- less maintenance

- **Aurora Serverless** for unpredictable workload /intermittent workload

- **Aurora multi-master** for continuous writes failover

- **Use case** work same as RDS but for less maintenance/more flexibility/more performance

- ### Aurora for Solution Architect

  - **operation**: less operation/ auto scaling
  - **Security** : same as RDS
  - **Reliability** : Multi AZ, aurora server less option, Multi master option
  - **Performance** high performance 15x times rather than RDS, and 15 replicas 
  - **price** pay for per hour for ec2 and storage

# Elastic Cache

- Managed Redis / Memechached (similar to RDS for it is cache)

- Must Provision ec2 instance

- Support for Clustering(Redis ) Multi AZ, Read Replicas (Sharding)

- Backup/snapshot point in time restore

- maintenance window and monitoring through cloud watch

- **Use Case**: key value store, for sub-latency and for frequent read, store session data for content of websites, do not use SQL

- ### Elastic Cache for Solution Architect

  - **Operation**: as same as RDS
  - **Security**: same and elastic authentication 
  - **Reliability**: clustering Multi AZ 
  - **Performance**: sub-milliseconds latency , read replicas and best option for in-memory cache
  - **price** price per hour for ec2 instance and storage used

# S3

- s3 is key-value store

- best for big objects, no maintenance,

- maximum object size is **5TB**

- serverless, strong consistency,versioning, encryption, cross region replication

- **use case**: best for big files, web hosting, multi-part upload for big files

- ### s3 for Solution Architect

  - **Operation**: no operation
  - **security**: IAM, bucket policy, ACL,encryption,SSL
  - **Reliability**: 99.999999999%, durability and  99.99% high availability
  - **Performance** : scales to thousands of read/ writes per seconds transfer acceleration multi-part uploading for big files
  - **Cost**: pay per storage, network usage, data transfer 

# Athena

- fully managed serverless service with SQL support

- to query data in s3

- pay per query and output results store in back into s3

- secured through IAM

- **use case**: one SQL queries , serverless queries on data in s3, log analytic

- ## Athena for Solution Architect

  - **Operation:** no operation need

  - **security:** IAM+S3 

  - **Performance** scales based on data size

  - **cost:** pay per query/ per TB data scanned

    

# Glue

- Managed extract, transform and load(ELT) service

- Useful to prepare and transform data for analytic

- fully serverless service

- ### Glue catalog

  - catalogs of datasets means metadata for of dataset
  - data crawler navigate and take meta for glue

# Neptune

- fully managed graph Databases

- why use

  - high relationalship data
  - social networking users and post,replied
  - knowledge graphs

- high availability across 3 AZ and and 15 read replicas

- point-in time recovery and backups

- ### Neptune for Solution Architect

  - **Operation**: no need
  - **Performance**: best for graph database
  - **cost** pay per node use utilize

# Elastic Search

- you can search any field in database or partially search is also available

- elastic search has some usage for big applications

- Comes with Kibana(Visualization) and logstash(log ingestion) - ELK(elastic search,logstash and kibana)

- ### Elastic search for Solution Architect

  - **operation**: similar to RDS
  - **Reliability**: Multi AZ , clustering
  - **Security**: Cognito, IAM ,VPC,KMS,SSL
  - **Performance**: based elastic search project
  - **Price** pay per node

# DynamoDB

- aws technology, serverless, noSQL,
- provisoned capacity, auto scaling, on-demand capacity
- Can replace **Elastic Cache** for key value store
- **DAX** for read cache in dynamoDB faster
- can only query to primary key , indexes
- **Use case** serverless application development(small documents 100kB), distributed serverless cache and can do transaction(from 2018)
-   **Performance**: single digit milliseconds performance  

# Redshift

-

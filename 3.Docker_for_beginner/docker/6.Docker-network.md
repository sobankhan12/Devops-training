# Docker Network

- it is used to isolate containers from same network and possibility of communication
- by default  network is bridge its subnet range is **172.17.0.0/24**

```bash
# how to create a network 
$ docker network create dev-team
# how to inspect network
$ docker network inspect dev-team
# how to create a network with specific subnet 
$ docker network create prod-team --subnet 10.100.0.0/24
# how to see network list
$ docker network ls
# how to delete unused network
$ docker network prune
# how to delete network normally like dev-team
$ docker network rm dev-team

```

### How to create containers with specific ip and communicate through different network bridges 

```bash
# create a container with specific ip
$ docker run -it --name cont1 -p 8000:80 --network dev-team --ip 10.100.0.2 --hostname soban252 ubuntu
# create another container
$ docker run -it --name cont2 -p 8001:80 --network prod-team --ip 10.200.0.2 --hostname soban252 ubuntu:18.02
# it will show network list
$ docker network ls 

```

### How to attach additional network with your containers

- create a common network and attach this network with all your containers like this

```bash
# create network
$ docker network create com-team --subnet 10.99.0.0/24
# first attach comm-team network with container 1
$ docker network connect com-team cont1
# now attach com-team network with container2
$ doker network connect com-team cont2

```

### How to disconnect network from containers

```bash
# how to disconnect network com-team from cont1 container
$ docker network disconnect com-team cont1
```

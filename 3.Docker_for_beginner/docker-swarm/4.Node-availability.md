# Node availability

- it is mostly used to handle nodes for traffic division
- three types of nodes
  - Active, pause, drain

### Pause

- it is used when our worker node is overloaded and we do not want to push other load on that node 

- so we put this node on pause state

- at this state those containers on this node will work and other containers will not be deployed on this node anymore

  ```bash
  # set node as pause
  $ docker node update --availability="pause" "node-id"
  ```

  

### Drain

- it is used to when you want to patch update on the specific worker node

- due to this running containers on this node will move on the active nodes

  ```bash
  #  set node as drain
  $ docker node update --availability="drain" "node-id"
  ```

# Docker Swarm

- it is used to handle containers in different node and it is used to orchestration of containers

- it is developed by docker community

- if your container is on one node but traffic goes to another node they will get response due to cluster

- create four ec2 instance to perform this task and make one manager and other three worker nodes

- and it will create token for worker nodes like this

  ```bash
  # to add node as worker
  docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-39xf7k0hvx3pq0njrqgq78daexfuqakmhufk3kj1207dbuh718-2mhdj0vqyqwhidwsdjnl988fa 172.31.84.177:2377
  # to add node as manager
  # how to add manager node 
  $ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-39xf7k0hvx3pq0njrqgq78daexfuqakmhufk3kj1207dbuh718-0kip6v91rq1mq3vbz3nzy4hzo 172.31.84.177:2377
  ```

  

```bash
# initialiaze docker swarm in one node and it will become manager by default
$ docker swarm init
# to see nodes list in manager and can not run this on worker-node
$ docker node ls
# how to promote a worker node to get permission like manager node
$ docker node promote "worker-node id"
# how to demote a promoted manager
$ docker node demote "worker-node id"
# how to to leave from cluster as worker-node
$ docker swarm leave
# how to remove worker-node from cluster through manager node
$ docker node rm "worker-node id"
$ docker node rm -f "worker-node id "  # for forcefully remove
# how to get token for worker in manager node
$ docker swarm join-token worker
# how to get token for manager in manager node
$ docker swarm join-token manager
# how to inspect worker-node
$ docker node inspect "node-id"




```

# Linux

- ## Introduction

  - it is a kernel launched in 1991 and was made by Linus Torvalds 
  - it is mostly known as operating system by mostly people
  - it is open source and mostly used in servers 

  - more secure, no license fee , light weight.

- ## Kernel

  - it is most important part of any operating system you can say it **heart** of operating system
  - any application or command first come to kernel then kernel it has sufficient memory to execute it and order to hardware to give response back 
  - it manage RAM, hard disk, cpu management
  
- ## OS

  - it is a part of system software
  - multiple software combine to become a OS(GUI, ls, cp, samba, Ansible)
  - **why need OS**
    - to operate hardware
  - **Types of OS**
    - single user and single task=> DOS(disk operating system made by Microsoft)
    - single user and multiple task=>Windows 10(media,chrome)
    - multi user and multi task OS **=>**(Windows server addition 12,..,Unix, linux)
    - **UNUX**
      - 1969 first Unix base operating system launched (**multics**)
      - 1970 **Unics** built through B language
      - 1973 **Unix** 
  - **Network installation of OS**
    - make a  PXE server boot and upload OS image on this server and then run service to supply like(NFS,Apache,FTP)
    - network device connected with any port of switch
  - **Linux File hierarchy**
    - root (it is home directory for root user)
    - boot( here all the boot files stored)
    - etc (all configuration files stored in this directory)
    - bin (all commands stored)
    - sbin( all commands that root can execute)
    - dev (all hard disk and pen drive stored over there)
    - lib (libraries of 32 bit)
    - lib64 (libraries of 64 bit)
    - opt ( all third parties software stored here)
    - proc (all process information stored over there)
    - mnt ( all mounting information is stored here)
    - run (when you want to see multimedia it help you)
    - usr (all information of user is stored like help, mail etc)

- ## Basic Commands

  - **Reboot**

    ```bash
    # How to reboot a system with gracefully mean first it stop all the process then
    # reboot
    $ systemctl reboot
    $ reboot
    # This command forcefully reboot instantly
    $ init 6
    # How to reboot a system with specific time
    $ shutdown -r 4:20
    # How to cancel reboot job with this command
    $ shutdown -c
    # it will run after 15 to the current time
    $ shutdown -r +15
    $ shutdown -r now
    # How to poweroff this sytem
    $ systemctl poweroff
    $ init 0
    # How to schedule poweroff with job
    $ shutdown -h 5:20
    
    
    ```

    

  - **ls**

    - to see list of commands

      ```bash
      # to see data on current directory
      $ ls
      # to see all detail of data it will show long list
      $ ls -l
      # to see hidden files and directories
      $ l.    # for centos and red hat
      $ ls  .?* # for ubuntu
      # to see all files including hidden
      $ ls -a
      # to see long list
      $ ll
      
      ```
      
      - cd command
      
      ```bash
      # come to previous working directory
      $ cd -
      # if you want to come to home directory
      $ cd ~
      $ cd 
      
      ```
      
      
  
  - **touch**
  
    - to create a new file
  
    - first job is to update timestamp of file to verify the status and second job is to create file
  
      ```bash
      # How to create multiple files
      $ touch a.txt b.html
      # How to create multiple files 
      $ touch abc{1..10}.txt
      # How to create a hidden file
      $ touch .hiddenfile
      # How to check status of file 
      $ stat abc.txt
      
      ```
  
  - **mkdir**
  
    ```bash
    # to create multiple directory
    $ mkdir soban soban1 soban2
    # to create hidden directory
    $ mkdir .soban
    # to create multiple directies
    $ mkdir soba{1..10}
    # to create directory with space
    $ mkdir soban\ khan
    $ mkdir "soban khan"
    # to create nested directories
    $ mkdir -p soban/asad/bilal
    ```
    
    
    
  - **cat and nl**
  
    - if you just read you must use nl command
    - if you want to create a file then use cat command
  
    ```bash
    # How to see content of file
    $ cat a.txt
    # How to write a file
    $ cat >b.txt
    # then press enter and ctl+d
    # How to append the date to the file
    $ cat>>b.txt 
    # How to show the data of file with line number
    $ cat -n b.txt
    # How to see data in reverse line
    $ tac b.txt
    # How to read a file with nl command
    $ nl a.txt
    $ nl 
    ```
  
    

  - **; and pipe(|)**

    - ; is used to run multiple commands at one time

    - | is used to manipulate the existing commands

      ```bash
      # we make directory go inside directory and then make a new file
      $ mkdir soban; cd soban; touch bilal.txt; ls
      # we use pipe command to manipulate the existing command
      $ cat bilal.txt | nl
      
      ```
      
      
  
  - **head and tail **
  
    - head and tail is used to see logs files and see content of large file
  
    - due to head you can see specific lines of file
  
    - head by default head show 10 top lines 
  
      ```bash
      # how to see logs of file
      $ tail -f /var/logs/messsages
      # how to see the content of file like 20 line number to 25
      $ head -n 25 /var/log/messages | nl | tail -n 5 

  - **rm and rename**

    - rm is used to remove file or directory from machine
  
    - r is used for recursively , v is used for visual means we see what is deleting or creating  and f is used for  forcefully
  
    - rename command is used to rename file or directory

    - n is used for no override
  
      ```bash
      # How to remove file
      $ rm -vf a.txt
      # How to delete all data in the folder
      $ rm -rvf /soban/*
      
      # how to remove folder
      $ rm -rvf old\ website
      # How to copy files with nooverride
      $ cp -rvfn ./* ./soban
      # how to rename file or folder
      $ rename "older name" "new name" "older name" # last is used for confirmation
      $ renmae abc.txt abc2.txt abc.txt
      # find all matches and rename
      $ find . -iname "*abc*" -exec rename _dbg.txt .txt '{}' \;
      ```
      
      
  
    
  
  - **cp and mv**
  
    - n is used for no override
  
      ```bash
      # n is used for skipping override
      $ cp -rvfn * /home/soban
      # mv is used to rename and move folder from one side to other directory 
      $ mv -rvf * /home/soban
      ```
      
      

```bash
# how to see only hidden files
$ l.
# how to see all files includes show and hidden with detail
$ ls -la
# how to create files
$ touch a.txt b.txt 
# how to create multiple files with number like abc1.html abc2.html
$ touch abc{1..11}.html
# how to create hidden files by using . at the start of file 
$ touch .a.txt
# how to make a directory in desktop with space
$ mkdir old\ website
$ mkdir "old website"
# how to layers based directory
$ mkdir -p laptop/soban
# how to just read content of file
$ cat a.txt
# how to read text with line number
$ cat -n a.txt
# how to read text of file reverse
$ tac a.txt
# if you just read file then it is mendatory to use nl command
$ nl a.txt
# how to create file and write text and then press ctl+d for save content
$ cat >a.txt
# how to append data in existing file
$ cat >>a.txt
# we make directory go inside directory and then make a new file
$ mkdir soban; cd soban; touch bilal.txt; ls
# we use pipe command to manipulate the existing command
$ cat bilal.txt | nl
# how to see logs of file
$ tail -f /var/logs/messsages
# how to see the content of file like 20 line number to 25
$ head -n 25 /var/log/messages | nl | tail -n 5 
# how to make a file with echo command
$ echo "how are you">>j.txt
# how to empty a existing file
$ echo "">j.txt
# how to append text through echo 
$ tail -n 6 /etc/passwd | nl | head -n 2 
```

# Linux user management

- it is used to create multiple user and keep track who changes in the server

- ## Types of Users

  - There are three types of users

  - Super users like **root**

    - uid=0, guid=0

  - System users like **dns, dhcp and samba**

    - uid and guid ranges from **1 - 999** in RHEL 7

  - Normal Users like **harry, soban, potter**

    - uid and guid ranges from **1000 - 60000**
    - you increase this limit by editing file /etc/login.defs

- ## How to create a user 

  ```bash
  # how to create a user
  $ useradd soban -C "it administrator" -u 1212 -d /home/soban -s /bin/bash # redhat
  # it work with ubuntu -G sudo for admin next users inside here -m for make home dire.
  $ useradd soban -C "it administrator" -u 1212-d /home/soban -s /bin/bash -m -G sudo
  
  # how to modify permission of  user
  $ usermod -s /sbin/nologin soban
  # how to set password for user
  $ passwd soban
  # how to add one user to specific group
  $ gpasswd -a  soban developer
  # how to add multiple users in group
  $ gpasswd -M soban,khalid,vijay developer
  # how to delete user not its directory
  $ userdel soban
  # how to delete a user with its directory
  $ userdel -rf soban
  ```

  

- ## Different scenarios of password for user

  - you must set password for normal user

  - Root user can switch to normal user even if user has no password set

  - Normal user can not switch to another user without password

  - Root user can lock password of normal user

  - if password of normal user is set but root user can switch to normal user without asking password

  - Root user can make password less user for all users

    ```bash
    # how to set password for user
    $ passwd soban
    # how to swith user
    $ su -soban
    # how to lock user
    $ passwd -l soban
    # how to unlock password of user
    $ passwd -u soban
    # how to delete password of make password less user
    $ passwd -d soban
    # how to see the status of user
    $ passwd -S soban
    # how to set password for a user through terminal
    $ echo soban123 | passwd --stdin noor2   # it does not work with ubuntu
    $ echo "noor2:soban123" | chpasswd # it work in ubuntu
    ```
    
    

- ## Account Policy of users

  ```bash
  # how to see user account policy according to requirement
  $ chage -l paddy
  # how to change user account policy according to requirement
  $ chage  paddy
  # how to change particular policy of user like warning days change
  $ chage -W 7 paddy
  ```

  

- ## New User account home directory and some payload as default

  ```bash
  # how to change a default home directory for new user account
  # got to /etc/default/useradd file then change this home directory path
  $ vi /etc/default/useradd
  # how to add some payload means some files give to every new user go this /etc/skel directory and some files over there
  $ cd /etc/skel; touch abc{1..10}
  # It create 10 files over there and these files will be default for every user
  ```

  

- ## How to create a user without useradd command

  ```bash
  #1. make a directory for user in home directory
  $ mkdir /home/soban
  # go to /etc/passwd then this line
  soban:x:1212:1212:"it admin":/home/soban:/bin/bash
  # go to /etc/group
  soban:x:12:soban
  #2. change owner and group of this user directory
  $ chown soban /home/soban
  $ chgrp soban /home/soban
  # copy all the data from /etc/skel
  $ cp -rvf .bash_logout .bash_profile .bashrc .mozilla
  
  # generate a passwd
  $ passwd soban
  ```

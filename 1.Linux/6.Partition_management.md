# Partition Management

- here we learn partition management how to partition of hard disk 

- ## Types of hard disk

  - SATA means **Serial Attach it is most  popular now**

    - its partitions like sda1, sda2, sda3

  - PATA means **Parallel Attach it is old fashion**

    - its partition like hda1,hda2, hda3 etc

    

- ## Types of Partition

  - **Primary**
    - we can make partitions of hard disk **min=1, max=4** 
    - it's id is 83
  - **Extended**
    - we can make partition of hard disk **min=0, max=1 id=5**
    - we can make up to 11  logical partition in extended partition according to red hat book
    -  **logical id=83 and sda6 will be more than 5 for identification**

- ## Commands for hard disk to make partition and mount

  ```bash
  # how to see list of harddisks
  $ fdisk -l
  $ lsblk
  # how to go into specific disk
  $ fdisk /dev/xvdf
  # how to create partition in this disk
  $ n
  # by given default primary and partition number and first sector 
  # then give size of partition in second sector
  $ +12G
  $ +500M
  # after making 3 primary partition and then add extended 4th partition
  # in extended you use default size so that remaining size go to extended partition and #then you make logical partition from extended
  # how to see partition in the disk 
  $ p
  # how to save partition 
  $ w
  # how to update operating system so that partition show
  $ partprobe /dev/xvdf
  # how to check partition is formatted if partition show in blkid then it is for.
  $ blkid
  # how to formate new partition
  $ mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf1
  $ mkfs -t ext3 /dev/xvdf2
  $ mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf3
  # how to mount new formatted partition
  $ mkdir /uni
  $ mount /dev/xvdf2 /uni
  # how to save this mounting after rebooting
  $ vim /etc/fstab
  # then add this line best practice is to used uuid of partition instead of name
  /dev/xvdf2    /uni    ext4    defaults    0  0
  # to save this mount means whatever your entry in fstab it will update 
  $ mount -a
  # now check your partition is mounted 
  $ df -h
  # how to unmount partition
  $ umount /uni
  # If you format any partition in VFAT then this pendrive can be used in window
  $ mkfs -t vfat /dev/xvdf3 
  # how to delete any partition
  $ fdisk /dev/xvdf
  $ d
  # then give partition number like 1,2,3
  
  ```
